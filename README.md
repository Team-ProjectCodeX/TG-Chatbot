# TG-Chatbot


A Python script that implements a chatbot functionality for a Telegram bot. The bot listens to incoming text messages and responds with AI-generated replies. It communicates with an external API (https://sugoi-api.vercel.app/chat) to generate the responses. If the API request is successful, the bot sends the generated response back to the user. If there are any errors or issues with the API, appropriate error messages are returned.
